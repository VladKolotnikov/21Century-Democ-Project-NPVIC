    <h1 id='mainTitle'>National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</h1>
    <h3 id='subTitle'>by: Vlad Kolotnikov</h3>

    <h5 class='bodySubTitle'>A closer look at the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</h5>
    <p class='bodyParagraph'>The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact was first drafted in January 2006, so it is not a new document. It's ultimate goal: to elect the president of the United States by popular vote, rather then the current
      electoral
      college votes. The NPVIC recognizes that an ammendment that would remove the Electoral College is unlikely to be passed, so it proposes a different method of achieving it's goal. The states that have signed the compact are obliged to vote, not
      only based on the votes of the people living withing those states, but rather based on the votes nationwide. In order for the compact to be successful it requires the majority of the Electoral College (currently 270 votes), so the plan is not
      in effect until that point has been reached. Currently the states that signed the compact have 195 votes collectively. Moreover, states that have NPVIC legislature pending have 78 votes collectively. Should every state with NPVIC pending pass
      this legislature, it would go into effect, and the next election will gurantee that the president elected is the president most voted for.</p>

    <h5 class='bodySubTitle' style='padding-top:30px'>A Brief History of NPVIC</h5>
    <p class=' bodyParagraph'>While many factors lead to the creation of the National Popular Vote Iterstate Compact, the largest spur was the fact that 5 times a president who lost the popular vote, ended up in office. <span class="italic">see
        table
        below</span>. This breaks the most fundamental principle of democracy. Every vote counts for as much as any other vote. Under the current system, you vote may be more or less important that your freind's vote, based solely on where you live.
      The spark that ignited the flame was the election of 2000, the first "electoral misfire" in 112 years or 28 electios. Compounded with over 700 electoral college reform proposals in Congress, as well as multiple poles by Gallup and other
      analytical companies since 1944 consistently showing the majority of the population prefers a direct vote, the NPVIC was born. In 2001 the Northwestern Univrsity law proffessor Robert W. Benett wrote a paper suggesting the stae could pressure
      the congress into a constitutional ammendment regarding the electoral college by pledgin their votes to the nation vote winner. Shortly after, the Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar, and his brother Vikram Amar, a professor at the University
      of California Hastings School of Law, sugggested states could coordinate their efforts in electing a president who is the winner of the national popular vote only after enough states are in agreement to control the electoral college. In 2006
      John Koza built up on the work by these law professors, and drafted the Compact, as well as formed the NPV inc. a non profit organization promoting NPVIC. As of today the Compact legislature was proposed in all 50 states, and adopted by 15
      states, as well as DC.</p>
