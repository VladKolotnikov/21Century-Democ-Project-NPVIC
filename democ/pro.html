      <tr>
        <td>Pros</td>
        <td>Cons</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The NPVIC ensures that never again will a candidate lose when the majority of the US citizens wanted to see them in power. This would encourage voting, as people's voices would be heard and acted upon.</td>

        <td>The original purpose of the Electoral College was to make sure that the candidate chosen, is a candidate that is qualified to lead the nation. Under NPVIC, if somehow a person not qualified is selected by majority vote, there is no
          fail safe. It should be noted however, that even though there were cases when states voted differently in the electoral college than did the people in those states, this has never been even close to changing the tide of any election
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Currently, the candidates only have to focus on the big swing states when campaigning, since a there is no advantage to securing more votes in a state, that historically has voted one way or another. All that matters in the end is how
          the states will vote, not how many people in the state voted for a candidate. This ironically means that states who have historically been avid supporters of one party, are the states that will most likely be neglected by both the
          opposing party, and the party they support. The NPVIC removes that. Under the compact it will not matter where a person lives. Every vote will count evenly, and candidates will be forced to spread their attention throughout the country,
          rather than simply focusing on a few key places. This ultimatel means that more voices are heard, and the US political system is more friendly to interact with for the majority. Under current system, many simply get discouraged by being
          ignored.</td>

        <td>The NPVIC may shift the candidates focus to urban areas where more people live. While this is a disadvantage of a popular vote, however, it is a much lesser one, than going against the majority vote like what is going on in the current
          system. Moreover, candidates focus on urban areas even under the current system, since they still need a majority within a state, so this is a con that does not come with NPVIC, but is rather inherant in democracy. The system encurages
          representatives to focus on areas where there are most people. This in actually can even not be concidered a con, since the candidates seek to make the majority happy, rather than the minority. It is the very opposite of elitist.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The NPVIC open potential to tinkering with the voting system the US. employs to elect her president. The current system is known as First Past the Post, or Winner Takes All. While from a first glance the system makes sense, it is
          mathematically flawed. There are many other systems, like the Alternative Vote, or the Single Transferable Vote that are better options. Currently a change in how the votes are calculated would call for an ammendment, however with NPVIC it
          will be easier to encorporate these changes.</td>
        <td>There are some legal problems with the National Popular Vote Compact, namely the compact clause of the constitution that states "No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation…. No State shall, without the Consent of
          Congress… enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State". However it is also true that the Election Clause trumps the Compact clause in this regard when it gives states planeary powers to cast their electoral votes however they
          wish. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Another pro of the NPVIC which is rarely spoken about, but is nonetheless extremely important is its rebellion against the Constitution. The NPVIC can usher in a new era where decision are made based on what it actual and helpful now and
          in the future, rather than what is more in accordance to a document written centuries ago.</td>
        <td>However this same pro can also backfire. The Constitution has worked for the US in the past, and change on such grand scale can be scary. The US law-making system is used to the sterness of the Constitution, keeping it in check. Should it
          be possible to be more flexible with laws, it can severely backfire. There are after all many examples of this legal flexibility leading to a corrupt government, most notably in Eastern European countries like Russia.</td>
